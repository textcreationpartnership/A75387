         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167893:3"/>the enemy vvith ſuch abundance of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naninity and dexterity of ſpirit, that they immediatly routed them, and embraced the purſuit for three or 4 miles, doing admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble execution and taking about 150 priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, vvith the loſs of 7 men.</p>
            <p>The enemy conſiſted of about 1500 men, being part of Gencairns Brigade, and going to unite and joyn with Middleton; againſt whom, valiant little Morgan is again deſigned; but the enemy decline engagement.</p>
            <p>By an Expreſs from Hainant the 27 of July it is certified, That the King of Scots being gone from Peron towards the Spaw, was met within a League of Peron by the marſhal Thurenne, and de la Ferte, who conducted him as far as the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; whence they returned with the D. of York, who is now made Lieutenant Generaliſſimo. Soon after the Governor of Cambray of the Spaniards, met the King of Scots, and conducted him to his Lodgings, and there feaſted him like a Prince: Since which time he is gone to the Spaw.</p>
            <p>The King of Sweden having ſent new Letters of Credence to Monſieur Bonnel his Reſident; his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167893:3"/>Lordſhip had Audience by his Highneſs in White-Hall, being attended by Sir Oliver Fleming, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Ceremonies, and divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>The French go on victoriouſly with the ſiege at Stenay; and with as much vigour before the Camp at Arras: Indeed, true it is, great has been their ſucceſs ſince the making of the Duke of York Lieutenant General; and that upon his approach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a League of the Spaniſh forces before Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras with the whole Army upon the way of Doway, where he intrenched upon a deſign to cut off all proviſions from the enemy; the Prince of Conde at firſt repreſented his Opinion at a Council of Officers, that the enemy being but 14000 the beſt way wold be to engage them with hopes of ſucceſs, but his advice was waved. Then the Duke gave them an alarum, and faced them with his horſe, which the French perceiving, made a ſally with ſome horſe and foot with ſuch vigor and reſolution, that they routed the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:167893:4"/>Spaniards at firſt; but the Prince of Conde coming in ſeaſonably rallied them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the French into the Town again with ſome loſs; in which conflict his Highneſs fought half an hour ſomtimes on horſeback and ſometimes on foot, at the head of the Trench, where the valiant Knight de Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, who commanded the French, had his Arm broken to pieces, and was hardly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off, and ſeveral other Officers and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were killed and taken.</p>
            <p>Since vvhich time, Marſhal Thurene hath preſented himſelf before the Spaniſh Lines, in hopes of breaking through to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the City; but the buſineſs proved not feaſible, ſo that they vvere forced to retreat with ſome loſs.</p>
            <p>Since that 5 or 6000 of the ſpaniſh horſe vvith ſome foot in the Rear, went to take
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167893:5"/>and fortifie the paſſage of ſaint Paul, five miles from Arras, and as many from Air, to ſecure the Convoys ſent toward the Spaniſh Camp, which Gen. Thurene having notice of, purſued them with a body of 7 or 8000 horſe, to ſpoil the deſign of the Spaniſh forces. But ſince that another party of 4000 horſe of the ſpaniſh Army have been to meet a Convoy, which they have conducted ſafe into the Camp; which being done, they were preſently ſent to joyn with the firſt party commanded towards the ſaid St. Paul; ſo that we do expect very ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear of ſome engagement between theſe two parties.</p>
